## Context Dump Rule

When Claude Code dumps context to the terminal, it should also write the same context dump to the docs/CONTEXT.md file.

The format should be:

1. An H1 heading with the current date and time stamp
2. The exact same context dump content that was written to the terminal

For example:

```markdown
# Context Dump - [Date and Time]

[Context dump content...]
```

This helps maintain a historical record of all context dumps for future reference.
