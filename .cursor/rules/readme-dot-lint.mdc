# README.lint Structure

Enforce README.md files to follow the README.lint format for consistent documentation.

## When
This should always be the format for README files.

## Structure
READMEs should have these sections in order:
1. Title (H1) with repo/project name
2. Why section (ğŸŒ¸ Why use [project]?)
3. Who section (ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ Who benefits from this?)
4. What section (ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ What does it do?)
5. How section (ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ How do I use it?)
6. Extras section (ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ Extras)

## Example
```markdown
# [Project Name]

ğŸŒ¸ Why use [Project Name]?
=============================
<!-- Why did we see the need to spend time and energy building this? -->


ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ Who benefits from this?
=============================
<!-- Who is this repo for? -->


ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ What does it do?
=============================
<!-- What, exactly, is this thing? -->


ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ How do I use it?
=============================
<!-- How do I set it up? How do I use it? -->


ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ğŸŒ¸ Extras
=============================
<!-- Anything else that doesn't fit into the above categories -->
```

## Notes
- Use H1 headings with `===` underline style for section headers
- Use ğŸŒ¸ emoji for visual distinction (one emoji for "Why", two for "Who", etc.)
- If a project prefers a different emoji, it should:
  1. Stick with one emoji type throughout
  2. Maintain consistent section headers (Why, Who, What, How, Extras)
- Add the README.lint badge to show conformance
- The "Why" section should explain why time and energy was spent building this
- The "Who" section should explain who the repo is for
- The "What" section should explain exactly what this thing is
- The "How" section should explain how to set it up and use it
- The "Extras" section should contain anything that doesn't fit into the above categories
