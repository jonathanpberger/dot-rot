# Context Dump - July 8, 2025, 5:35 PM

## Current State of `yday` Project Extraction

### Project Structure
- **Main Repository**: `/Users/jpb/workspace/dot-rot` (dotfiles and
configuration)
- **Extracted Tool**: `/Users/jpb/workspace/yday` (standalone npm package)
- **Status**: Phase 1 complete - core semantic analysis implemented

### Key Components

**dot-rot (Configuration Repository):**
- `docs/adr/001-extract-workflow-tools.md` - ADR documenting extraction decision
- `EXTRACTION_PLAN.md` - Implementation plan and phases
- `bin/yday-semantic` - Original tool (to be deprecated)
- `bin/shadow-work` - Original tool (to be deprecated)
- `.cursor/rules/` - Development rules including README.lint and YAGNI

**yday (Extracted Tool Repository):**
- `package.json` - npm package config with commander, chalk, yaml dependencies
- `bin/yday` - CLI entry point with comprehensive flag support
- `src/index.js` - Main application logic and routing
- `src/time-periods.js` - Smart time handling (Monday → Friday, etc.)
- `src/git-analysis.js` - git-standup integration and commit parsing
- `src/semantic.js` - Semantic commit analysis (extracted from yday-semantic)
- `src/timeline.js` - Placeholder for Alastair-style timeline view
- `src/shadow.js` - Placeholder for shadow work analysis
- `MEMORY-BANK/CONTEXT.md` - Context dump per cursor rules

### Current Implementation Status

**✅ Working Features:**
- Basic semantic analysis of commits across multiple repos
- Smart time period handling (yesterday, Friday on Monday, etc.)
- Full git-standup integration with -d, -u, -A, -B flags
- New `--on` flag for specific day (single day, N days ago)
- Comprehensive CLI help with implementation status
- Verbose debugging mode (`-v, --verbose`)
- Dependency checking (git-standup, gh CLI)
- Enhanced help text with date format examples

**⚠️ Recent Fixes:**
- Fixed default behavior to show "recent work" instead of strict yesterday
- Added support for multiple date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY/MM/DD, 'Mon DD
YYYY')
- Improved time period descriptions for better user understanding
- Removed unnecessary author filtering per YAGNI principle

**❌ Not Yet Implemented:**
- `--alastair` timeline view (MTWRFSs pattern)
- `--shadow` mode (GitHub project tracking gaps)
- Configuration file support (~/.config/yday.yml)

### Architecture Decision (ADR-001)
Extracted workflow tools from dot-rot into standalone repositories to maintain
clean separation of concerns:
- **dot-rot** = system configuration only (shell, VS Code, macOS defaults)
- **yday** = shareable development tool (npm package)
- **gday** (in dot-rot) = personal workflow orchestration

### README.lint Compliance Issue
Current yday README uses 📜 emojis instead of required 🌸 structure. Needs to be
updated to:
- 🌸 Why use yday?
- 🌸🌸 Who benefits from this?
- 🌸🌸🌸 What does it do?
- 🌸🌸🌸🌸 How do I use it?
- 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 Extras

### Git Repository Status
Both repositories have uncommitted changes that need to be committed:

**dot-rot changes:**
- ADR and extraction plan documentation
- Context dump per cursor rules

**yday changes:**
- Complete initial implementation
- Package configuration and CLI setup
- Core semantic analysis functionality
- Context dump documentation

### Next Steps
1. Commit changes to both repositories with appropriate messages
2. Update yday README to be README.lint compliant
3. Implement `--alastair` timeline view
4. Implement `--shadow` mode with GitHub integration
5. Update dot-rot to use extracted yday package
6. Remove deprecated tools from dot-rot/bin

### Integration with "now.md" Workflow
The extracted yday tool maintains compatibility with the existing "now.md"
knowledge capture workflow:
- `gday` will call extracted yday for git summaries
- Supports foam-based daily note structure
- Maintains current daily routine while enabling tool sharing
